# Simple-Security-System-Application
The Simple Security System Application is a security solution that uses a camera to capture images based on user input. The system logs the events and stores images with a timestamped filename in a JSON file.
This application uses a button (enter) pressing event to trigger the capturing of a image. 

 ### Assumptions
1. The system assumes that a functional camera is available on the device.

2. The camera must be accessible through OpenCV (if using an external camera, ensure drivers are installed).

3. The system is designed to capture one image at a time and log the event.
