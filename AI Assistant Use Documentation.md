 # AI Assistant Use Documentation
During the development process of the Simple Security System Application, an AI assistant was used to enhance coding productivity and assist in problem-solving tasks. 
The AI provided suggestions on structure, coding best practices, and error handling.

### AI-Generated Code Examples

Here are a few examples of AI-generated code snippets:

1. Error Logging Setup:

   logging.basicConfig(filename=ERROR_LOG_FILE, level=logging.ERROR,
                    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

2. Event Logging Function:
   
    event = {
        "timestamp": datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") }
